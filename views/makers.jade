					| Developing Your Idea. These are only guidelines. 
					| We are encouraging creativity, so don’t take these as rules.
				p.mm-gray 
					| Try to develop something the kids will take away after Maker Madness. 
					| If it’s software, for example, have them create a web site, 
					| or android games on their phones, rather than just learning to 
					| program with an exercise. If you are teaching math, have them use math to 
					| make something. If you are teaching music, have them make an instrument.
				p.mm-gray 
					|You can sequence different techniques, such as having one station to build 
					| something, and another station to paint or decorate it.
				p.mm-gray 
					| Try to determine if you will you need additional volunteers to 
					| help run your station, either skilled or not?
				p.mm-gray 
					| Think through factors like noise and fumes. Avoid chemicals with fumes, 
					| as our stations will be indoors.  We expect that this could be a very noisy event, 
					| so things that are slightly quieter are preferable. If hammering is involved, 
					|maybe have the kids do it on the floor instead of on a table.

					|We suggest projects that limit the amount of time it takes 
					|each kid to complete them to 15 minutes.  If the project is more 
					|involved&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;perhaps for older kids&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;it is ok 
					|if it takes longer, but the idea is to be able to have lots of kids making things. 
					|Tying up resources (particularly people to help and supervise) would limit that.
				p.mm-gray 
					|Think about the flow. Does each kid stay at a station the whole time, 
					|or do you have kids moving down a kind of assembly line as they complete their project?  
				p.mm-gray 
					|How many kids can work on a project at once? You may want to set a 
					|limit on the number of kids working at one time, and have others wait in line, or come back later.

					Try your station project out on as many kids and adults as you can to get a better idea
					|of how long it takes, what might be difficult to understand or build, could the process be 
					|streamlined, etc.
