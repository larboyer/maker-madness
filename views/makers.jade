				p.mm-gray Developing Your Idea. Lorum Ipsum the rain in spain falls mostly on the plain.
				p.mm-gray Developing Your Idea. These are only guidelines. We are encouraging creativity, so don’t take these as rules.
				p.mm-gray Try to develop something the kids will take away after Maker Madness. If it’s software, for example, have them create a web site, or android games on their phones, rather than just learning to program with an exercise. If you are teaching math, have them use math to make something. If you are teaching music, have them make an instrument.
				p.mm-gray You can sequence different techniques, such as having one station to build something, and another station to paint or decorate it.
				p.mm-gray Try to determine if you will you need additional volunteers to help run your station, either skilled or not?
				p.mm-gray Think through factors like noise and fumes. Avoid chemicals with fumes, as our stations will be indoors.  We expect that this could be a very noisy event, so things that are slightly quieter are preferable. If hammering is involved, maybe have the kids do it on the floor instead of on a table.
		h3.mm-purple Making
		p.mm-gray We suggest projects that limit the amount of time it takes each kid to complete them to 15 minutes.  If the project is more involved--perhaps for older kids--it is ok if it takes longer, but the idea is to be able to have lots of kids making things. Tying up resources (particularly people to help and supervise) would limit that.
		p.mm-gray Think about the flow. Does each kid stay at a station the whole time, or do you have kids moving down a kind of assembly line as they complete their project?  
		p.mm-gray How many kids can work on a project at once? You may want to set a limit on the number of kids working at one time, and have others wait in line, or come back later.
		h3.mm-red Testing
		p.mm-gray We are planning some Friday night test runs where we invite a few kids and adults to someone’s house to build things, to get a sense of how long things take, what 
materials are needed, and to troubleshoot.
